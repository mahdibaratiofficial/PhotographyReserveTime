* Modify the docs locally or directly in the GitHub GUI.
* If you are submitting documentation for the **current stable release**, submit it to the corresponding branch. For example, documentation for Livewire 2 would be submitted to the `2.x` branch. Documentation intended for the next release of Livewire should be submitted to the `master` branch.
* Thatâ€™s it, thanks for contributing!
